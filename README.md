### Here is the story of this repo

I once seen a challenge on Internet (here: http://www.code-story.net/). So, in
a view to fulfill it, I decided to provide a solution. But my first question
was: "which language I'll used?"

For the language, there are many choices. But, before to explore languages I
do not really master, I have prefered to started with the one I know by
heart: Java. This is the result you get under the tag `foobarqix-solution-1`
(https://github.com/fsarradin/code-story/tree/foobarqix-solution-1).

But I did not want to stop here. Thus, I have created a new branch and in a
view to make things harder, I have rewrote the solution with heavy use of
the interface Function provided by Guava, strongly inspired by the
functional paradigm. You can see the result in the branch `fp-appraoch`
(https://github.com/fsarradin/code-story/tree/fp-approach).

But I would like to go further. So, I have created another a new branch and
decided to develop a solution using Java 8's lambda expression. Here is the
result: `java8` (https://github.com/fsarradin/code-story/tree/java8).

Will I stop here or continue? No, I stop here!
